## Introduction

Congratulations, you have made it to the very first React project. In this project, you will be creating a small application where users can input their information and generate a CV/résumé. It’s a great project to get you started because it includes many of the basic concepts you’ve learned so far, without a huge overhead of complexity.

## Post-project review

I'm not going to spend a whole lot of time on the details. This is the first React project, so it's about the basics, and I want to continue. I've only used React in one project, so this still took some time to get right. I think this turned out fine.

## Brainstorming

Inputs could be combined with labels to make larger, reusable components. Those larger components can be combined into sections. Since this is my first project, I'm just gonna wing it. I've build an app before with React, so I'm not entirely new to it.
